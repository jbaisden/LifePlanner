FIGURE OUT LIFE CYCLE OF COMPONENTS...CLIENT-LIST needs to be able to call init once 
to get the client list, but subscribe to the service so updates are made available to 
it. This way we can test the edit-client component and ensure the service updates the 
right client in the list.


GENERAL STRUCTURE THOUGHTS

LOG-SESSION SHOULD PROBABLY BE MOVED INTO ITS OWN FOLDER AS THIS WILL NEED 
    A LIST COMPONENT EVENTUALLY.

RESIST URGE TO IMPLEMENT FIREBASE - ONLY DO THIS WHEN LIFE CYCLE ISSUES ARE FIGURED OUT
    AND YOU CAN READ/SAVE/DELETE FROM SERVICE ARRAYS CONSISTENTLY.
